# Hi, I’m Sarah 👋 
<!--- ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Sarah-A&color=green) --->

I'm a senior developer with over 18 years of experience with different languages and technologies. 
After many years of working mainly on embedded, real time and desktop applications, in the last three years I've been expending my knowledge in web development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything web-dev: front end, back end and cloud.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting web-development project, where I can expend my knowledge and contribute!
